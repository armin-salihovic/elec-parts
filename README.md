## About ElecParts

ElecParts is an electronic parts & projects management system designed to be used as a web application. Inspiration comes from building electronics projects, specifically, guitar pedals, and not being able to keep track of the parts used and the number of projects created. 

Some of the currently available features include:

- Managing of local and distributor parts
- Managing of inventory by location
- Importing of [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) products
- Creating projects
- Starting project builds
